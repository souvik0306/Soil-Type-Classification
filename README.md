The dataset is a very small dataset meant for beginners to build ML models using this dataset currently. A small dataset helps in learning without wasting hefty time in training the model for half an hour or more and expensive computation. The results won't be really great as the dataset is really low and thus overfitting and other issues.

## Objectives - 
• Designed a classification model with 5 classes and 98% testing accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network. 

• Applied Data Augmentation and reduced validation losses by 30% by applying MobileNetV2 Architecture.
